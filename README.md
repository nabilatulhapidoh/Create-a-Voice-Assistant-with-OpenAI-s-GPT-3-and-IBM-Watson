# Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson
## Author : Cognitive Class AI
--------------------------------

In this guided project, you'll learn how to build your own AI assistant using OpenAI's pre-trained GPT-3 model. Unlike the popular ChatGPT which communicates with text, your personal assistant will use voice. You will use Watson Speech-to-Text to give your AI assistant the gift of hearing and Watson Text-to-Speech so that your assistant can read the answers back to you.
